# Workflow Automation Scripts

Welcome to the Workflow Automation Toolkit — a collection of Python scripts designed to boost productivity, streamline routine tasks, and simplify your developer and DSA journey.

This repository is organized into submodules based on purpose: DSA automation and Git automation for now.

## Why this exists?

Because I got tired of doing the same things over and over again manually.  
It's not meant to be production-grade — just a bunch of helpful experiments.

## Note

- No index here. This folder is a sandbox.
- These scripts are tailored for my own folder structure. If you want to adapt them, you might need to tweak paths/configs or simply adopt the same folder structure.
